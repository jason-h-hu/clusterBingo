============

Using MongoDB's MMS service's API its easy to deploy complex clusters to EC2 and other targets. Before you can deploy MongoDB you need O/S to be provisioned on the right hardware, kernel parameters tuned, file-systems and disk topologies laid out, Java and Python packages installed etc. The goal is to ensure that a consistent setup is achieved before any performance or other regression suite is run enabling a correct side-by-side comparison of results.
