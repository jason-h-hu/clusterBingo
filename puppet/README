All the modules I'm using are based off of the production notes from MongoDB. (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/production-notes/) 

Unfortunately, all the modules are really, really half baked. 

MODULE 				DESCRIPTION
mongodb 			Installs mongoDB
os 					Ensures that it's a known operating system
concurrency			Doesn't do anything at the moment
journaling 			Doesn't do anything at the moment
networking			Sets up a very weak firewall, allowing only default mongo ports. Broken. 
hardware			Nothing at the moment
swap				Creates a swap file, to ensure we have 2x swapspace of memory. 
raid				Nothing
nfs					Disables the NFS protocol, by default
kernel
	atime			This should disable atime,but doesn't do anything at the moment
	filedescriptor	This ups the filedescriptor limit, but I don't think it works. 
	hugepages 		This is supposed to disable huge pages but I think it also requires a restart?
	numa 			???
	readahead		This can set the readahead, but it can't find devices yet
	ntp				This turns on ntp
